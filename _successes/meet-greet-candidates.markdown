Members of Indivisible Johnstown were happy to meet with the Democratic candidates vying to challenge Rep. Rothfus in the 12th Congressional District.  The event, held on Tuesday August 8th, was attended by more than 50 local constituents who were given the chance to talk one on one with the 4 candidates who are runnning on the Democratic ticket this spring.

After each candidate was given 5 minutes to introduce themselves, the meeting turned casual with each candidate mingling with voters, answering questions on their positions and listening to concerns.   Members of the press were invited to interview the candidates and get footage for their readers and viewers.

One of the main discussions was the amount of money the elected Democrat will need in order to battle Rep. Keith Rothfus who currently has more than an $800,000 war chest.  Big money is behind Rothfus and the Democratic National Committee has not targeted Pennsylvania's 12th district for funding in the 2018 general election.  That means it will be incumbent on everyday citizens to provide campaign funding.

Indivisible Johnstown will work toward convincing the DNC that we need their financial help in flipping the 12th and putting in place a Representative of the people who will act as a check and balance on Trump's unconstitutional agenda.
