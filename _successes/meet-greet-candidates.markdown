Members of Indivisible Johnstown were happy to meet with the Democratic candidates vying to challenge Rep. Rothfus in the 12th Congressional District.  The event, held on Tuesday August 8th, was attended by more than 50 local constituents who were given the chance to talk one on one with the 4 candidates who are runnning on the Democratic ticket this spring.

After each candidate was given 5 minutes to introduce themselves, the meeting turned casual with each candidate mingling with voters and answering questions on their positions and listening to concerns.
