In response to the Donald J Trump agenda, Indivisible Johnstown opens a new chapter with a welcome mat for all.

Update 08/24/2017: 
After 216 days in office it is abundantly obvious that Donald J Trump is unfit and unhinged.  He is a clear and present danger to the United States of America.  From legitimizing hate groups to fighting with his own party, dissing our foreign allies while admiring dictators, making a profit from the Presidency, questioning the independent judiciary and calling the free press "the enemy of the American people".  He consistently shows disdain for the Constitution.  He is a danger to the country both domestically and on the international stage.

Join us in our efforts to oust this authoritarian kleptocrat from the highest office in the land.
