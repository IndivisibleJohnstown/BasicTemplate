I was blessed from day one.  I was given the best parents any child could ask for.  I was the last of 4 children born to my Dad, a high school teacher and Mom, a stay at home mother and, later, a secretary for a school district.  They worked hard, taught us to be responsible and caring and prepared us for the challenges of life.

Beginning in 1990, when Mom and Dad were in their mid-60’s, they began to suffer some significant but common health problems. We noticed a behavioral change in my mother that, after years of different doctors and facilities, was finally diagnosed as Bipolar disease.  In my day, we used to call it Manic Depression, a term I contend better describes the symptoms.  Concurrently my father began to be more and more forgetful and this man, a holder of a master’s degree, often searched for the right words.  The diagnosis was, as you might have guessed, Dementia.

Mom and Dad continued to live in their split level house in Richland Township until 2002 when, after a few falls, they knew it was time to give up their beloved home and move to a structure more feasible for older folk.  Because of their mental health conditions, they were failing to take their medications so independent living was no longer possible.

So in 2002 they chose to move into a very nice Assisted Living facility.  Now Mom and Dad were, by no means poor and by no means rich.  They were smart people who took the paychecks of a teacher and invested every chance they got.  As a result they put their children through college and feathered their nest egg to a comfortable level.  Let’s just say that they entered the elderly health care system with several hundred thousand dollars in their nest egg.

Their Assisted Living home was comfy cozy with lovely outdoor spaces and an anti-fall elevator.  The staff attended to my parents’ needs which basically consisted of making sure they got their meds.  But in a few years more health problems set in.  Mom developed diabetes and Parkinson’s while Dad was diagnosed with congenital heart disease.  They were getting dangerously close to surpassing the level of care the Assisted Living facility could support.

In 2007, at the age of 84, Dad passed away.

Mom stayed in Assisted Living for another year but then her Parkinson’s began to affect her ability to swallow.  We placed her in a Skilled Nursing Center, today’s politically correct term for a nursing home, which I shall refer to as “the home” henceforth.

Remember their nest egg?  That egg got shattered.  Mom started out getting the therapy she needed, until the money ran out.  This is to say, she had reached her insurance cap.  After that, there was no more therapy to improve her ability to swallow or to exercise her body or to stimulate her mind.
She was permanently tethered to her feeding tube. After decades of paying for insurance, the system began to fail her.  To the point that the care she received consisted of administering medications, getting her out of bed, helping her dress and sitting her in her chair.  And who paid for that?  Medicare and Medicaid. You see, Mom had lost her wealth to healthcare and was now eligible for Medicaid.  Without Medicaid, I don't know what we kids would have done.

Mom passed away in 2010, the year the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) went into effect.  The only thing Mom had left was her life insurance which allowed us to bury her.  Full disclosure, we were more fortunate than most in that we inherited several thousand dollars.

Mom had a relatively comfortable home in which to spend the last years of her life.  But it came at a price.  One that, increasingly, the average American cannot afford.  It is not only unacceptable to financially bankrupt an elderly person approaching the end of life, it is **morally** bankrupt to expose families to health/wealth insecurity.

 While, the ACA needs some fixing, the Republican insistence on throwing the baby out with the bathwater is reckless, morally lacking and in direct opposition to what polls now show as the will of most Americans. Now, the individual mandate has been overturned, removing millions from the insurance pool that keeps costs down for everyone.  Trump's chipping away of ACA through executive orders flies in the face of decency, humanity and the will of the American people.
