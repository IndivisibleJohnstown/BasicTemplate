  SAMPLE CALL SCRIPT - (Our personal story follows)

  **Caller:** Hello! My name is [ ] and I’m calling from [part of state]. Can you tell me how Senator [ ] will vote on the Graham-Cassidy health care bill if it comes up for a vote?

  **Staffer:** The Senator hasn’t reviewed the text of the bill yet and hasn’t taken a position on it. There is no vote scheduled on that bill though.

  **Caller:** I want Senator [ ] to oppose Graham-Cassidy. The bill is just like other TrumpCare bills in that it destroys Medicaid as we know it by turning Medicaid into a capped system. This hurts children with disabilities, seniors, and even victims of natural disasters like Harvey and Irma. It also takes away funding to help people afford health insurance through the marketplace, and it hurts states that have expanded Medicaid.

  **Staffer:** Obamacare is a failure. The Senator believes we must stabilize the market and lower premiums.

  **Caller:** If that’s what the Senator wants to do, then supporting the bipartisan, transparent process that Senators Alexander and Murray are leading through regular order would be a better option than supporting the Graham-Cassidy bill. I expect Senator [ ] to respect regular order and reject the Graham-Cassidy bill if it comes to a vote.

  **Staffer:** I’ll let the Senator know your thoughts.

  **Caller:** Yes, please do. I will be watching this vote closely and I expect Senator [ ] to oppose. Please take down my contact information so you can let me know what Senator [ ] decides to do.

I was blessed from day one.  I was given the best parents any child could ask for.  I was the last of 4 children born to my Dad, a high school teacher and Mom, a stay at home mother and, later, a secretary for a school district.  They worked hard, taught us to be responsible and caring and prepared us for the challenges of life.

Beginning in 1990, when Mom and Dad were in their mid-60’s, they began to suffer some significant but common health problems. We noticed a behavioral change in my mother that, after years of different doctors and facilities, was finally diagnosed as Bipolar disease.  In my day, we used to call it Manic Depression, a term I contend better describes the symptoms.  Concurrently my father began to be more and more forgetful and this man, a holder of a master’s degree, often searched for the right words.  The diagnosis was, as you might have guessed, Dementia.

Mom and Dad continued to live in their split level house in Richland Township until 2002 when, after a few falls, they knew it was time to give up their beloved home and move to a structure more feasible for older folk.  Because of their mental health conditions, they were failing to take their medications so independent living was no longer possible.

So in 2002 they chose to move into a very nice Assisted Living facility.  Now Mom and Dad were, by no means poor and by no means rich.  They were smart people who took the paychecks of a teacher and invested every chance they got.  As a result they put their children through college and feathered their nest egg to a comfortable level.  Let’s just say that they entered the elderly health care system with several hundred thousand dollars in their nest egg.

Their Assisted Living home was comfy cozy with lovely outdoor spaces and an anti-fall elevator.  The staff attended to my parents’ needs which basically consisted of making sure they got their meds.  But in a few years more health problems set in.  Mom developed diabetes and Parkinson’s while Dad was diagnosed with congenital heart disease.  They were getting dangerously close to surpassing the level of care the Assisted Living facility could support.

In 2007, at the age of 84, Dad passed away.

Mom stayed in Assisted Living for another year but then her Parkinson’s began to affect her ability to swallow.  We placed her in a Skilled Nursing Center, today’s politically correct term for a nursing home, which I shall refer to as “the home” henceforth.

Remember their nest egg?  That egg got shattered.  Mom started out getting the therapy she needed, until the money ran out.  This is to say, she had reached her insurance cap.  After that, there was no more therapy to improve her ability to swallow or to exercise her body or to stimulate her mind.
After decades of paying for insurance, the system began to fail her.  To the point that the care she received consisted of administering medications, getting her out of bed, helping her dress and making sure she ate her meals.  And who paid for that?  Medicare and Medicaid. You see, Mom had lost her wealth to healthcare and was now eligible for Medicaid.  Without Medicaid, I don't know what we kids would have done.

Mom passed away in 2010, the year the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) went into effect.  The only thing Mom had left was her life insurance which allowed us to bury her.  Full disclosure, we were more fortunate than most in that we inherited several thousand dollars.

Mom had a relatively comfortable home in which to spend the last years of her life.  But it came at a price.  One that, increasingly, the average American cannot afford.  It is not only unacceptable to financially bankrupt an elderly person approaching the end of life, it is **morally** bankrupt to expose families to health/wealth insecurity.

Graham-Cassidy is more of the same earlier attempts at repeal and replace the ACA.   It will increase premiums, out of pocket costs, does not contain any guarantees for pre-existing conditions, is ageist with its increased cost burden on the over 60 crowd, decreases funding for opioid/heroin  addiction and is being opposed by the health care industry including Blue Cross. It will not only roll back the Medicaid expansion but will go beyond with more funding decreases through 2026.  For political reasons, the GOP is rushing through another bill that is one sixth of our economy without a CBO score.  Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has admitted Graham-Cassidy is very flawed but he shook his fist at Republicans and reminded them that they ran on repeal and replace.  Mr. Grassley and his colleagues are ignoring the fact that the situation on the ground has changed.  Americans want the peace of mind of affordable, effective healthcare.

 While, the ACA needs some fixing, the Republican insistence on throwing the baby out with the bathwater is reckless, morally lacking and in direct opposition to what polls now show as the will of most Americans.  We have until September 30, 2017 to convince the Senate we reject the Make America Sick Again bill known as Graham-Cassidy.

Along with our own hard line Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) here are the Senators we have identified who may be persuaded to vote against this bad legislation.  Above is a script outline for you to use, if you so desire.  Please call as often as you can.
