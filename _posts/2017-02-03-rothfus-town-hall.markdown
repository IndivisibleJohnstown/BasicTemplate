Infamous for not holding town halls and meeting with constituents for 10 minutes 1 person at a time Rep. Keith Rothfus has actively skirted his duties to the voters. Indivisible Johnstown has extended an invitation to Rep. Keith Rothfus to participate in a town hall on June 1, while he's in town for Showcase for Commerce.  With or without the Congressman from the 12th district, citizens are invited to come and talk about what concerns them most.
