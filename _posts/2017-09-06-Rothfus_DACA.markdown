  Hello,

  My name is ____, and I am one of your constituents from zip code ______. I am calling to express my discontent with the White House’s decision to end DACA and ask Senator __________ to support Senate Bill S1615 and Representative ______ to support House Bill HR3440, legislative action that will protect immigrants affected by the termination of DACA. Eight hundred thousand lives and billions of dollars lost to the economy are affected because of the president’s decision to end DACA. Now it is time for Congress to pass a law that would provide a pathway to citizenship for this group of immigrants. Does Senator/Representative _____ currently support these bills?

Congressman Keith Rothfus politicizes the lives of Dreamers, those who were brought to this country by their parents.  Young people who have a 90% rate of attending college and/or are gainfully employed.  DACA turned these immigrants into productive, tax paying members of our communities.  The economic effects of deporting this workforce is estimated to cost the US economy between 433 and 600 BILLION dollars in the next 10 years.  These are not gang members...they would never give their information to the government.  These are kids who are contributing to our country.

By accusing Barack Obama of pandering to his base, Rothfus first ignores the constant, blatant base pandering his man Trump does in place of true legislation that is helpful to the American people.  Rothfus ignores the urgency of the time when, in 2012 after 30 years of Congressional failure to enact immigration reform, Barack Obama took action to bring these young people out into the open and allow them to instead contribute to the societies in which they live.  And have lived, all or most of their lives.

His accusations of unconstitutional Executive Action and citing Rule of Law is laughable.  Trump has shown himself more than willing to dance on the Constitutional line with accusations of Fake Media leading the way.  The free press is enshrined in the 1st Amendment to the Constitution and was placed there by our founders as a check and balance that ensures the people are aware of the actions of our government.  The Free Press is the 1st line of defense in free countries and are the first to be attacked by would be authoritarians.  History is littered with the blood of journalists who are marginalized or murdered by autocratic regimes.  Think Vladimir Putin.  Trump's unconstitutional rhetoric also includes degrading the 3rd branch of government, the Judiciary.  His profiting from the office of the President is a violation of the Emoluments Clause.  His attempts to exclude Muslim immigrants is in direct violation of the Exclusion clause instructing Congress that they "shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."

 While Rothfus seems to support the Rule of Law he conveniently ignores Trump's pardon of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the Maricopa county law enforcement officer sworn to uphold the Constitution who ran, in his words, a "Concentration camp".  His prisoners, including American citizens arrested on SUSPICION, were subjected to extreme weather conditions, unsafe sanitary conditions and other harsh treatment one finds in a banana republic.   Trump's embrace of the KKK, neo-Nazis and other alt right groups shows a disdain for the Constitutions declaration that "all men are created equal".

The people of the PA 12th Congressional district deserve better.  Rep. Keith Rothfus blindly supports the anti-Constitutional policies, actions, rhetoric and policies of Donald J Trump.  In addition to Mr. Rothfus' lack of basic economic understanding, his statement glaringly lacks empathy, compassion and heart.  Just like his dear leader.  In 2018, we will flip the 12th district and show our Rep.in the House of Representatives that those who do not defend the Constitution from an autocratic regime are not welcome in our House.
