One of the things we can do right here in our backyard is to flip the 12th district.  These candidates have thrown their hats into the ring for the primary this coming spring.  The winner will take on Congressman Keith Rothfus and his 97% Trump voting record.  Come meet them in person on Tuesday, August 8th.

Hello all!

   We hope you're having a great summer!  We have planned another event for you that we hope you can attend.  Here's the details...

What:   Meet & Greet the Democratic Candidates for 12th Congressional Dist.
When:  Tuesday, August 8, 2017 from 6 – 7:30pm
Where:  345 Market St., Loft 1
              Johnstown, PA 15901
 
You’re invited to meet the folks who will be competing in next May’s Democratic primary to become the party’s general election candidate for the 12th Congressional District.  This is not a forum or debate but, rather, a casual meet and greet where you can mingle with the candidates.  This is an RSVP event so reply to this email ASAP to reserve your spot!
 
Here’s a quick look at each candidate:
 
**Aaron Anthony** is a father, a teacher, an expert in education policy and a dedicated community servant. He lives with his wife, Lauren and their two-year-old daughter in Shaler, PA. Aaron is committed to ensuring that all people have access to quality education, healthcare, childcare and job opportunities. He's seen the world, traveling to over 45 countries, only to realize that the best change he could make is right here at home. With steadfast support for evidence-based, compassionate policy solutions, he is running to represent Pennsylvania’s 12th Congressional District in 2018.
 
**Tom Prigg** grew up in Washington, PA, in a poor, blue-collar family and is now a Research Associate at Carnegie Mellon University.   He’s an Army Veteran who served in Panama and in the 82nd Airborne as a scout sniper and machine gunner. He’s a concerned citizen-candidate that is willing to take on a corrupt government. If elected, his plan is to work with local Pennsylvania groups so that he can introduce and fight for legislation that will help our state’s communities grow and stay strong.

**Beth Tarasi** grew up in a family with a history of hard work and commitment.  She attended the University of Pittsburgh on a women's basketball scholarship. Upon graduating law school she began practicing law with her father running a successful litigation firm. Her experience learning from and working with her father has taught her that she has to fight for justice for the people she represents. She resides in Sewickley with her husband Tony Sinatra (a veteran) and her parents. Her sons are grown and living in other cities with far less impressive sports teams.

**John Stolz** is a Professor of Biology and Director of the Center for Environmental Research and Education at Duquesne University. He has studied climate change, energy, and sustainability. Working diligently to protect our water resources and promote renewable energy, his research helped get arsenic out of chicken feed, and provides free well water testing for communities with shale gas drilling. He has worked with both Allegheny County and the City of Pittsburgh on environmental issues. He moved to Pittsburgh in 1990 and has lived in Glenshaw with his wife Donna since 1994. He will use his experience and work ethic to be a strong advocate for working families and the environment, while taking a fiscally sound approach to government services.
