[Example Link](http://example.com) Today's Daily Action is to call your senators to reiterate that Sam Clovis is a terrible choice for Chief Scientist for Department of Agriculture. Sam Clovis not an agricultural scientist, nor is he an agricultural economist, nor does he appear to be qualified for a position that, by law, must be drawn from “among distinguished scientists with specialized training or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.”

Trump had to know he was inviting controversy last month by tapping Clovis, a former Iowa Senate candidate and conservative radio host, to be a top scientist at USDA. For starters, he doesn’t believe in climate change.

If you're keeping track, Clovis is also under fire for previous comments arguing that homosexuality is a choice and that the sanctioning of same-sex marriage could lead to the legalization of pedophilia.  On top of that, Clovis is another climate change denier. 

With Clovis' Senate confirmation hearing coming up, it seems his only real qualification for this job was the co-chair and policy advisor for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and his current responsibility for crafting policy and explaining it in media appearances for the campaign.

 So tell your Senators we need to see a few more resumes for this position because Sam Clovis is not a scientist and is wholly unqualified for the job.
