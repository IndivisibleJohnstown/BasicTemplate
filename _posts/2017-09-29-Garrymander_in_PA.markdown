  My name is (    ) from zip code (     ) and I’m calling to urge (Rep. name) to support (**HB722** if addressing a house member), (**SB22** if addressing a Senator).

  I believe it is time the drawing of Pennsylvania’s electoral districts be taken out of the hands of politicians.  I am in favor of the creation of a citizen commission tasked with redrawing the electoral map based on population only.  Please pressure members of the State Government committee to bring this bill out of committee and to the floor for a full vote by the (House) (Senate)

Ger·ry·man·der

verb
Manipulate the boundaries of (an electoral constituency) so as to favor one party or class.

Psy·cho·graph·ics
noun
The study and classification of people according to their attitudes, aspirations, and other psychological criteria, especially in market research.

Like all states, Pennsylvania’s electoral districts are redrawn every 10 years after the Census.  Like many states, our district lines are decided by the Republicans or the Democrats, depending on which party controls the legislature the year after the Census is taken. 
 
The problem with this system is that each party uses sophisticated mapping software to identify voters who are friendly to the party in power.  This mapping software utilizes psychographics to determine who is or is not friendly to the ruling party based on personal data ranging from Social Media posts to what magazines are delivered to our homes.  This data is then used to draw maps that all but guarantee the voters in these districts deliver a candidate running on the ruling party’s ticket.

As of May 2017, the two party breakdown of registered voters in PA, according to the PA Department of State’s department of Voter Registration, consisted of 4,051,103 Democrats and 3,235,781 Republicans.  Yet the Commonwealth is represented on the federal level disproportionately by a party that is in the minority by close to 1 million voters.  In 2012, Democrats won slightly more than 50% of the total vote in Pennsylvania Federal House elections (50.5% in fact), yet only five of the state's 18 seats in the federal House of Representatives are Democrats.  Historically, this inequity has existed no matter which party is in control.  The map gets redrawn to favor the ruling party.

Pennsylvanians have a rare opportunity to finally address Gerrymandering through Redistricting Reform.  House bill 722 (HB722) and Senate bill 22 (SB22) are now in the State Government committees and we need to get these bills to the floors for a vote.  These bills propose replacing politicians with a non-partisan citizen commission tasked with redrawing the electoral districts based on population only, excluding psychographics in the algorithms of the mapping software.

However, these bills are stuck in committee by their Chairmen, Senator Mike Folmer (R-48th district - (717) 783-1707) and House member Daryl Metcalf (R-12th district - (717) 274-6735)

Now is the time to apply pressure to these Chairmen along with our local representatives to bring these bills to the floor for an up or down vote.  Forcing this vote into the light of day needs to be done quickly before the window of opportunity closes.

Please hit the phones and call your local rep.  Tell them the time has come for redistricting reform.
