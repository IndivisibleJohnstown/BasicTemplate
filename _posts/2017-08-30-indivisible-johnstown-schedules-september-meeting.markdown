Join us for our September 2017 meeting on Thursday, Sept. 14 from 6 - 7:30pm.  We'll discuss applying pressure on Rep. Keith Rothfus and Senator Pat Toomey to defend the Constitution and the Republic from Donald Trump.

Plus, we'll be right in the middle of the debt ceiling debate and the new budget.  Our guess is that this budget will propose huge tax breaks for the rich as an argument that this will increase jobs.  It's called trickle down economics and it does not work.

We'll also look at flipping the 12th congressional district by unseating Keith Rothfus and we'll update you on the efforts for redistricting reform in PA.

Lots to go over after the summer so please make plans to join us!
