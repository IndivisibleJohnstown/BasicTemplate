What:  Why Courts Matter - The importance of the federal 
       judiciary & how it affects our daily lives

When:	Thursday, January 11, 2018 @ 6pm

Where:  345 Main St., Suite 1 (2nd floor) downtown Johnstown

Who:    Presented by Kadida Kenner, sponsored by Indivisible 
        Johnstown

Indivisible Johnstown is pleased to present Kadida Kenner of Why Courts Matter for an evening of education and lively discussion on our Federal Judiciary and the impact these lifetime appointments have on our daily lives.

No matter the issue - voting rights, employment discrimination, environmental regulation, health care, immigration - our federal judiciary plays an important role in the lives of hardworking Americans.

The Why Courts Matter Pennsylvania coalition plays a unique role in educating Pennsylvanians about the importance of the federal judiciary.

The issues you care about the most will eventually be arbitrated in federal courts.  From our district courts up to the U.S. Supreme Court, we must advocate for mainstream, independent, fair, qualified and diverse judicial nominees who will not be rubber stamps for an out-of-control administration.

"We are seeing the President appoint wholly unqualified and partisan "loyalists" to our Federal benches", said Mary Lou Davis of Indivisible Johnstown.  "And our elected representatives in Congress are rubber stamping these lifetime appointments.  We are happy to present an eye opening experience to the public whom we hope to empower through information and action".
