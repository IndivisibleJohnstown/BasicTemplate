The FCC, under Donald J Trump, is about to lift a cap on the amount of local TV stations that can be owned by any one company.  That will clear the way for WJAC-TV parent company Sinclair Broadcast Group, already the country's largest media company, to purchase rival Tribune Media.  This will give Sinclair more than 70% market share of US TV households including penetration in markets like New York and LA.

    This is a coming storm.  One that could not only change the landscape of the media, a shift that is taking place as we speak, but could pose a real risk to the Republic.

    One of the more brilliant ideas inserted into our Constitution by our founders is the veneration of what has become known as the fourth estate, the free and independent press.  They chose to make it the very 1st amendment to the Constitution of the United States demonstrating that they felt strongly that the role of the free press would keep the government in check and guard against the rise of royalty or any other form of autocratic governing.

Throughout our history, there has always been a press of differing opinion.  The left/right slant we see in the news today is nothing new.  Early publications, some printed by hand on leaflets, were distributed by different enterprises with varying opinions.  18th century newspapers with names like “Porcupine's Gazette”, Pittsburgh's “The Tree of Liberty” and Benjamin Franklin's “The Pennsylvania Gazette”.  There were countless news publications, all with their own opinions.  Together, they provided the public with a variety of discourse, much of which gave voice to the common man.

Print news evolved into radio and television stations from coast to coast.  Concerned over the growing power of large corporations and conglomerates, the administration of President Franklin Roosevelt wanted to make sure the country’s budding mass communications systems did not fall into the hands of a select few.   The Communications Act of 1934 created the Federal Communications Commission and tasked the independent agency with a range of responsibilities intended to serve the public good.

Since then, rules changes at the FCC, enacted by partisan board members appointed by Republican and Democratic Presidents alike, have eroded the bulwark against exposing the public to the opinions of a few.  And the greatest erosion has occurred in the past 34 years.  In 1983, 90% of American media was owned by 50 companies.  By 2011 that same 90% was owned by a mere 6 companies (GE, News Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner & CBS).


The original mission of the FCC is now in the final throes of this assault by a President that is intent on controlling the message and sowing doubt about the validity of news organizations who question his version of the truth by labeling them “Fake News”.  Trump has many conspirators in this march toward controlled propaganda.  Breitbart principal investors Robert & Diana Mercer, Sinclair Broadcast Group's David Smith, Fox News parent company News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch, Bloomberg Media CEO Michael Bloomberg.  These billionaires project their world view through their media holdings.

Oversight of the FCC in the Senate and the House is the job of the Commerce Committees. Senate committee Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) has praised Trump's FCC Chair Ajit Pai.  “Under Chairman Pai’s leadership”, Thune said, “the FCC has the opportunity to chart a path away from heavy-handed intervention in competitive markets and work collaboratively with Congress to create a modern regulatory agency that better meets the needs of consumers”

But the agency's consideration of lifting ownership rules is anything but intended to meet the needs of the consumers.  Instead it is a veiled effort, under the banner of “competitive markets”, to allow the few to feed their opinions to the many.

What makes Sinclair even more insidious than cable and internet delivered news is that it is the largest “owner” of the public airwaves, free over the air TV stations that can be picked up with an antenna.  As of July 2017, 13.3% of Americans get their TV from the local airwaves. These are older, poorer and rural citizens.  In addition, many more subscribe to basic cable which still gives them the big networks on local stations.  No Fox News, no MSNBC or CNN.  Just the local news, which surveys show is trusted more by viewers than those national guys.  This allows Sinclair to capture their audience and to prey on local loyalty and trust.

It's time to harken back to Ronald Reagan and his break up of “Ma Bell” in 1984.  Not only should the FCC reverse it's course of allowing looser regulations on ownership rules, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1974 should be utilized to break up the media behemoths.  If we don't, the free flow of information and varied opinions will become shackled with the propaganda of a few.
