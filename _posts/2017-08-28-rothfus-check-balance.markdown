call-script-text: My name is __________________ and I live in the 12th district in
  zip code ______________.  I am concerned that Donald Trump is attempting to destroy
  our Democratic Republic and our Constitution.  He is in violation of the Emoluments
  Clause and is making decisions that are not in the best interest of Americans.  These
  decisions and actions are intended to enrich the Trump Organization and put money
  in the pocket of the President.  His labeling of the press as "enemies of the people"
  is in violation of the 1st amendment and his questioning of the validity of the
  judiciary violates the 3rd amendment.  He has endangered this country both domestically
  and internationally.  At the very least Congress needs to censure this president.  When
  will Congressman Rothfus put country before party by standing up for the Constitution
  and challenging President Trump?

One commitment every Congressman & Senator makes is  "I, Keith Rothfus, do solemnly swear  that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.‚Äù

Rep. Rothfus does not seem to recognize Donald J Trump as an enemy of the Constitution.  Beyond Twitter, Trump's words and actions have been consistently unconstitutional.  From making money from the Presidency to pardoning a law enforcement officer found guilty of 1st amendment violations to giving comfort to hate groups who advocate Constitutional violations, Trump is embarking on a mission to deconstruct the Constitution.  And Keith Rothfus doesn't see the urgency, let alone speak out forcefully in defense of the country, it's security and it's Constitution.  Rothfus' myopic pursuit of the Republican agenda has put party above country.

So what has Keith Rothfus done for you lately?  How about voting in favor of [HR10 - Financial Choice Act of 2017](https://votesmart.org/bill/22915/financial-choice-act-of-2017#.WaRBniiGNPY).  HR10 repealed Frank Dodd and prior regulations designed to avoid repeating the same reckless financial practices that lead to the crash of 2008.  Know someone who lost their home as a result?  Thanks to this legislation it can happen again.  The bill also weakens the Consumer Financial Protection Board like undoing regulations requiring financial advisers to work on behalf of their clients' best interests and allowing lending companies to again engage in predatory lending. (See Rothfus' voting record [here](https://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/119466/keith-rothfus#.WaQ7_SiGNPZ).) Given that Rothfus' largest donors are from Securities & Investment, Insurance, banking and real estate, it's easy to see whose side he is on...and it's not yours.  (See Rothfus donors[ here](http://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00031253&cycle=2018&type=C).)

Let us not continue to vote for the incumbent simply because of name recognition.  Take a good hard look at what Congressman Keith Rothfus is doing and ask yourself "does this help me?".  We think you'll find the answer is a resounding "NO".  Spread the word, elect someone who will check and balance this president and defend the Constitution.  In 2018 Flip the 12th!
